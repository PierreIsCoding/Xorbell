# Dual Xorbell

The Xorbell is very simple and cool little drum module. 
It gives a metallic cowbell like sound.

The Original concept came from Elliot Williams: https://hackaday.com/2015/04/10/logic-noise-more-cmos-cowbell/
However I got the idea from Kristian Bl√•sol's Modular in a week day 9.3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50Wdc--Ln-g&list=PLyE56WXw0_5Q5QGMEXWmskuhojKyRdA3T&index=49

I added two opamp output buffers, and changed the potentiometers to fixed values and added two switches that let you choose between two sounds each. The dual Xorbell gives you two lower tweaked and two higher tweaked Xorbells. The pots let you change the decay of the sound. I encourage you to breadboard this project first and find your sweetspot values for R1, R2, R8, R9, R10 and R11. 

Keep in mind that this module uses a trick for the input gates + decay. By this the output volume depends on the input voltage and how that incomming trigger / gate is buffered. Therefore an improvement would be to add proper input buffers.
