# Dual Xorbell

The Xorbell is very simple and cool little drum module. 
It gives a metallic cowbell like sound.

The Original concept came from Elliot Williams: https://hackaday.com/2015/04/10/logic-noise-more-cmos-cowbell/
However I got the idea from Kristian Blasol Modular in a week day 9.3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50Wdc--Ln-g&list=PLyE56WXw0_5Q5QGMEXWmskuhojKyRdA3T&index=49

I added two opamp output buffers, and changed the potentiometers to fixed values and added two switches that let you choose between two sounds each. With this the module gives you two lower tweaked and two higher tweaked Xorbells. I encourage you to breadboard this project first and find your sweetspot values for R8, R9, R10 and R11.
